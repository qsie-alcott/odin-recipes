            <li>2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup basil pesto, store-bought or homemade</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks While Making These Meatballs</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wet your hands before rolling:</strong>  The meatball mixture can easily stick to your hands when you’re rolling it. Lightly wetting your hands before you start helps prevent this from happening so you form smooth balls.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn the broiler on at the end:</strong> These meatballs are baked rather than fried, which means cooking is less messy but you lose some browning. To counter this, turn your oven’s broiler on in the last few minutes of cooking to help turn the tops of the meatballs golden brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Make ahead, if you like:</strong> Bake a tray or two of meatballs, and, once cool, move the baking sheets to the freezer. Let the meatballs freeze solid, then transfer to a zip-top freezer bag for up to one month. Thaw them in the refrigerator overnight before rewarming in the oven, or thaw directly in simmering sauce for about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</h3>Arrange a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li><h3>Make the meatball mixture:</h3>Place the ground chicken, breadcrumbs, pesto, egg, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix lightly with a fork until just combined</li>
            <li><h3>Form the meatballs:</h3>Form the meat mixture into 20 (about 1 1/2-inch) meatballs and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them out evenly as you go. </li>
            <li><h3>Bake the meatballs:</h3>Bake until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle reads 165°F, about 15 minutes. Switch the oven to broil and continue to cook until the tops of the meatballs turn golden-brown in spots, 3 to 5 minutes more. 

                Serve with additional basil pesto or warmed marinara sauce for dipping.
                
                Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
